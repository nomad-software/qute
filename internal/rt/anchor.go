// Go state attached to a Qt object — the closures of its signal connections,
// its Go subclass value, the references it keeps — must live as long as the
// object does, even when no Go variable refers to the object any more. A
// global root (a cgo.Handle, the strong set) would do that, but it also keeps
// alive everything the state refers to: a button's clicked handler that
// mentions its dialog would keep the dialog from ever being collected, since
// Go cannot see a cycle that runs through C++.
//
// So a handle with such state is anchored instead: held strongly by the Go
// handle of the root of its Qt object tree when that root is an Owned QObject
// (the object GC frees, and with it the whole tree), and by the global strong
// set otherwise. The cycle window -> handler -> window then lies entirely in
// the Go heap, and an unreachable hidden window is collected with its
// handlers. When an object moves to another tree, the event filter reports it
// and its anchored state moves with it.
//
// A handle that is itself a root (a parentless window with its own
// connections) is anchored globally: rule "pinned while it has connections".
//
// Qt calls back with integer ids. The id table holds handles weakly, so it
// is no GC root; a callback whose tree was collected but not yet deleted (the
// cleanup queue has not run) finds nothing and is skipped.
