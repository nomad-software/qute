// A QObject is still handed to Go while it is being destroyed: the destroyed
// signal passes the object itself (OnDestroyed), and other signals Qt emits
// from a destructor can carry it too. By then the death notice has removed
// its registry entry, so wrapping it as usual would register a new handle
// whose own death notice can never come: Qt drops connections made during
// destruction. That stale entry outlives the object, and the next object Qt
// puts at the same address would be given the wrong handle, never watched,
// and used after it is freed.
//
// So Wrap asks Qt whether the object is being destroyed (QObjectData's
// wasDeleted, or a widget's in_destructor; see isDying) and, if it is, registers
// nothing: it returns the handle the object had, Dead, so a handler that
// compares it with the wrappers it holds finds the same Go pointer, or a
// fresh Dead handle when Go held none. The handles of objects being destroyed
// are remembered here from their death notice until the GUI thread is back
// in its event loop, when no destructor is running any more.

// dyingC reports whether the QObject at p is being destroyed (nil in tests
// without Qt). It reads QObjectData::wasDeleted, which ~QObject sets before
// it emits destroyed; a class whose own destructor emits it earlier (QWidget)
// adds a probe for its own flag.
