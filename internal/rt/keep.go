// Qt often keeps a pointer to an object it does not own: a view's model, a
// stream's device, a button's menu. Go code that drops its last reference to
// such an object would let the GC free it underneath Qt, so the overlay rules
// `keep`, `keep-each` and `release` make the receiver hold a strong reference
// instead (PySide's reference-keeping). A kept reference lasts until the
// receiver dies, the slot is replaced, or a release rule drops it.
//
// The references live on the owner's handle. A registered owner (a QObject
// or notify-dtor object) can outlive every Go variable that refers to it, so
// while it keeps anything its handle is anchored (see anchor.go): held by the
// root of its object tree, or globally. The references then last exactly as
// long as the object, and a window whose view keeps a model that refers back
// to the window can still be collected as a whole.

// frees a kept object only once no live keeper holds it (see Drain). Both
// maps are keyed by handle serial, so they outlive the handles: a keeper's
