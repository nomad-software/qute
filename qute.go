// Package qute runs Qt applications from Go and provides the tools that make
// them checkable without a human at the screen: headless screenshots and an
// object tree dump. Tests and scripted input are in package qutetest.

// A minimal program:
//
//	func main() {
//		qute.Main(func() {
//			w := qtwidgets.NewQWidget(nil)
//			w.SetWindowTitle("Hello")
//			w.Show()
//		})
//	}

// Main. From other goroutines use Post or PostSync.
